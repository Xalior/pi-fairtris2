# macOS ships GNU make 3.81 as `make`; Homebrew installs a current one as
# `gmake`. 3.81 compares file timestamps to the SECOND, so a source rewritten
# within the same second its object was compiled in is never seen as newer:
# the object stays in the link carrying the older text, and anything read off
# that image describes a file that no longer exists. It answers confidently
# and wrongly, which is worse than stopping. Make 4.x compares to the
# nanosecond, which APFS records.

# Dry runs
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `make -n` EXECUTES any recipe line containing $(MAKE): make marks such a line
# always-run so a dry run can descend into the sub-make. A recursive target
# therefore builds for real under -n. Targets that recurse put NOT_DRY_RUN on
# their first line and refuse instead; the `+` prefix is what makes that line
# itself run under -n.

# The cross toolchain
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The cross compiler is looked for on PATH first, so a machine that already has
# it installed is left alone. Failing that, RAPI_TOOLCHAIN_DIR names one
# unpacked toolchain, or a directory holding one or more unpacked releases.
#
# The toolchain is never searched for beyond that and never fetched. Free
# Pascal must use the same assembler Circle's build does, for its objects to
# link with Circle's, so there is one toolchain in the picture and it is named
# rather than discovered.
#
# There is no copy in this port: it is a couple of gigabytes of vendor
# binaries. Download release 15.2.Rel1 for the aarch64-none-elf target,
# matching the machine you build ON, from
# https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads, unpack it
# somewhere, and name it.
